# Practical Analysis of Sorting Algorithms (Academic Project)

This repository contains a small collaborative academic project focused on analyzing the *practical* time complexity of classical sorting algorithms. The goal is to compare theoretical expectations with empirical performance using systematic experimentation across different input sizes.

## What this project demonstrates
- Algorithmic reasoning and complexity awareness
- Empirical evaluation (benchmarking) using consistent methodology
- The difference between theoretical behavior and practical performance (constants, implementation details)

## Algorithms included
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- (Python built-in `sorted`) as a reference baseline

## How to run
Requirements: Python 3.9+ (standard library only)

From the project root:
```bash
python -m src.benchmark
