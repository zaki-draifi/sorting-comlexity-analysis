# Practical Analysis of Sorting Algorithms (Academic Project)

This repository contains a small collaborative academic project focused on analyzing the *practical* time complexity of classical sorting algorithms. The goal is to compare theoretical expectations with empirical performance using systematic experimentation across different input sizes.

## What this project demonstrates
- Algorithmic reasoning and complexity awareness
- Empirical evaluation (benchmarking) using consistent methodology
- The difference between theoretical behavior and practical performance (constants, implementation details)

## Algorithms included
- Bubble Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- (Python built-in `sorted`) as a reference baseline

## How to run
Requirements: Python 3.9+ (standard library only)

From the project root:
```bash

python -m src.benchmark## Output Format

Running the benchmark prints a CSV-like table to the terminal with the following columns:

- `algorithm`: name of the sorting algorithm  
- `n`: input size  
- `avg_ms`: average runtime in milliseconds  

## Notes

- This is an educational benchmark. Results may vary depending on the machine and background processes.
- The goal is not absolute speed, but observing scaling behavior as input size increases.
